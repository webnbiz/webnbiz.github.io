# 2 mindsets to approach blogging 

1. Finding niche/good/low competition topics with best opportunities and focusing on making money.
1. Doing what you like & creating content related to that.

OR -- May be a good mix of both is the best approach.

Some people might argue that second method is the right way to do it. But if you can provide value to readers then there is not much difference.
